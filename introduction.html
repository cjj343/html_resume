    <p>Here’s to changing careers at 30! In the words of Tolkien, “Not all those who wander are lost”
    - but I was definitely lost! </p>
    
    <p>I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2011 with a degree in History.   
    I loved History in high school and still have a passion for it to this day.   However, a degree 
    in History didn’t necessarily translate into the type of career I envisioned for myself.   It's 
    not that it didn’t equip me with any skills.   In fact, I have found many of the skills that I 
    learned from my first degree are helping me to get my second.   Whether its research, synthesizing 
    information, or simply knowing how to ask the right questions, I am grateful for my humble B.A.</p>
    
    <p>Anyways, I didn’t have the hard skills many employers were looking for.   I did a few odd jobs 
    here and there, not really getting any traction.   Frustrated,  I decided that I needed a new 
    direction and purpose in my life.   So, in 2013 I enlisted in the Air Force and started down a path 
    I had never envisioned myself.</p>

    <p>As a Cryptologic Linguist, I spent 2 years learning a new language in an immersive environment.   
    It was a challenging and humbling experience.   Everyday, for 10 hours, we were expected to speak 
    in our target language.   And guess what.   When you got back home and your brain was melted, you 
    better get right to studying.   It was tough but worth it!</p>

    <p>After learning my language, I went off to my permanent station in Georgia.   My experience in 
    Georgia was rewarding but exhausting.   I had a chance to work an exciting mission and help US 
    service members stay safe in combat zones.   But such work had a high price.   There were 16 hour 
    days (and even longer nights), 24/7 on call status, and high stress.   I knew I would need a change 
    after my enlistment was completed.</p>

    <p>Thanks to an annoying and time consuming task at work, I discovered a new passion.   I thought to 
    myself, “how can I make a robot do this?”  This small bit of workplace automation started a deep dive 
    into the world of computer science.   I started with some free online MOOCs like Harvard’s cs50 and 
    then eventually decided to enroll in a Computer Science program at Oregon State University in 2016.   
    Fast forward to 2018 and I am still in love with the subject.   I have focused most of my efforts so 
    far on fundamentals, particularly my school work in C/C++ and a personal project building a complete 
    16 bit computer.   This website is part of an effort to expand my skills into the realm of the useful
    by learning full stack web development!</p>
